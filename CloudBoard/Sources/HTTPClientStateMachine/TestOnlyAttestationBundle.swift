// A brief explanation for why this exists here.
//
// When testing (never in customer) it is not always tenable to get a proper SEP backed key and associated
// CloudAttestation. Instead conventional (in memroy) keys are used.
// The clients are informed of these keys through a serialisation protocol that must 'fit' into the same
// messages as are used for the real CloudAttestaions (as this is how the PublicKey and other information is
// passed in the proper production paths to retain the needed privacy gurantees)
//
// Since the attestation format is not controled by this project, and has important verifiability requirements,
// it is undesirable for the testing code paths to try to 'fake' something that is parsable as a
// CloudAttestaion. An alternative format is therefore required which can be hidden behind an abstraction
// layer. This code provides that formatting so it can be defined in one place
//
// Since:
// - LocalCloudboardClient needs to depend on this
// - Lots of other targets which do not depend on LocalCloudboardClient needs to depend on this
//    - It is undesirable for many of those to depend on LocalCloudboardClient
// - Creating a target just for this is overkill
// - We make use of the OHTTP formats to do this encoding
//
// Putting that code here is deemed reasonable
//
// So there is no confusion, this code is NOT a security/Privacy concern. This is entirely impossible to
// use in customer, during local development testing we don't care about that, just exercising almost all
// the same paths as the proper production paths where feasible.
