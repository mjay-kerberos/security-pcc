# VirtMesh for distributed VRE

This sub-folder contains VirtMesh code to support distributed inferences on VRE. It contains two major components, a guest-side kext an a host-side plugin.

The guest-side kext is a kext implementation of CIOMesh kext interfaces, but inherently use Virt IO interfaces to transmit data, because CIO is not available in a virtual machine.

The host-side plugin is a virtualization framework plugin, which implements the Virt IO device and communicate with (1) the guest-side kext for guest-host data exchange and (2) other plugins from other virtual machines to transmit data across VMs.

For more details, please refer to:


## Guest Kext

The `Guest/` folder has the implementation of guest kexts, where two kexts are implemented:

1. A `AppleVirtMeshIOBridge` base class for setting up Virt IO interfaces to communicate data between guest and host.
2. A `AppleVirtMesh` class derived from `AppleVirtMeshIOBridge` to actually implement CIOMesh kext interfaces.

This separated base-derived classes make them easier to test:

1. We can first mount the VirtMeshIOridge to test Virt IO functionalities, without worrying any of mesh-related code interfering the test.
2. And then mount the VirtMesh kext to test mesh functionalities, with the confidence that Virt IO is already functional.

> Note:
>
> 1. The `AppleVirtMeshIOBridge` is only served for a base class. It compiles to a kext for testing purpose only, it should not be shipped because it doesn't have any mesh-related functionalities. The `AppleVirtMesh` should be shipped.
>
> 2. The IOVirtIOPrimaryMatch magic number 0x1a0e106b is used to match a Virt IO device in the guest OS. The 0x106b is Apple device's default vendor PCI ID, and 0x1a0e is the PCI device ID for VirtMesh device which I selected as the next available enum after kAvpStrongIdentityDevice, see Virtualization repo for more details.
>
> 3. The Guest kext's plist files are based on AppleVirtIO project's Entropy device settings, with added AppleVirtIOPCITransport settings to match the non-default device ID 0x106b provided by VirtMesh plugin.

## Host Plugin

The host plugin can be loaded and executed by the Virtualization framework, and it serves as an XPC endpoint, to communicate data with other plugins. Each VM has only one plugin with it.

The host plugin also implements a broker to coordinate all plugins in the host machine.

Both the plugin and the broker should be shipped.

## Tests

VirtMesh comes we a few unit tests (or more like integration tests) which are compiled as standalone GoogleTest binaries.

To use such tests, compile them using cmake, copy the compiled binary to the guest VM and execute them. Each test connects to a specific kext and exercises test cases to test that kext's interfaces:

1. `GuestVirtIOTest`: This tests the AppleVirtIO's Entropy device, if success, it means the AppleVirtIO is properly installed and set up in the guest. It's a check to see if VirtIO is installed, and does not test any VirtMesh interfaces.
